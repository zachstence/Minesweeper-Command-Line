# Minesweeper-Command-Line

The classic game Minesweeper played in the command line. Coded in C++.

I began this project a few months back during spring break when I was on a camping trip without wifi. The goal was to create the classic game Minesweeper in the command line using C++. The game works as it should but more features will be added in the future when I have some spare time.
